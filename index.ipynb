    "One of the most popular uses for python is for data analysis and visualisation. You might have created a graph in MicroSoft Excel before. During this process we have to click around the software to modify our graph's appearance/what data it takes as an input. This might not take too much time if you're only doing it once but what if you had to make similar graphs another ten times? A hundred times? Or a thousand times? The process would quickly get very boring, take a lot of time, and you'd be more likely to make mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a python package called `matplotlib` to help us plot data using python. In this case, our program is a series of instructions telling matplotlib what data to use and how to format it. Its very customisable and you can use the same code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity is a little more difficult than the ones before it. Don't worry if you don't understand how all the code works. Here you will mostly copy and paste it and just edit snippets. The aim is to show you how python is used for plotting since this is important in lots of jobs like data science and research!\n",

    "In these activities we have used Python to visualise data. In the first activity we created and customised a line chart (how do these compare to the ones you might have made in Microsoft Excel?). In the second we learned about maps and co-ordinates, and how we can use Python to create our own maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively communicating information via data visualisation is a hugely important skill in the 21st century in many fields. Health care professionals and scientists especially need to know how to communicate effectively with the public to convey their findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning how to interpret charts and graphs is just as important. People can use graphics to accidentally or intentionally mislead people and make the data appear to say something different. For example, take a look at this graph produced by St. Louis Fed (USA) below:\n",

    "At a glance this graph would appear to suggest China has dramatically higher spending than all the other countries in 2020. But if we read the figure legend carefully we can see that there are two y-axes for the data. China, Russia, the UK, India and Saudi Arabia are all plotted on the left axis. The USA alone is plotted on the right axis. In reality the USA spent nearly $800 billion on its military, whereas China only spent ~$250 billion. Whilst the data plotted is technically correct the way it was visualised is very misleading. Take a look at this other visualisation that conveys nearly the same information:\n",

    "Here, the creators used a bar chart alongside a stacked bar chart to show the proportions of military spending. Though the time dimension was lost, this graphic is a lot more truthful and a lot more effective! St. Louis Fed (USA) later issued an apology and clarification for the misleading nature of their original graphic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Misleading data visualisation techniques were used frequently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to spread misinformation. By creating our own data visualisations we can hopefully gain a greater understanding of how they are used and misused in media, and critically engage with the ones we see in the news.\n",
